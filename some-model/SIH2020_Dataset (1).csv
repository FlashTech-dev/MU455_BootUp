Readers of Dean Koontz's Frankenstein have been anticipating the final volume in the series for years.,Neutral,Neutral
"Released late last month, Dead and Alive wraps up the author's modernization of the Frankenstein story four years later than originally planned.",Neutral,Neutral
Reasons for the delay include Koontz's dislike of working with co-authors (both of whose names have been dropped from new printings of books one and two) to the effect of the real-life Hurricane Katrina on the story's New Orleans setting.,Neutral,Neutral
They would have been just as appropriately armed with rubber-band guns and paper clips.,Neutral,Neutral
He even sets up a possible sequel and makes a connection to his popular Odd Thomas series.,Neutral,Neutral
I used to wait in anticipation for the next Scarpetta novel to come out.,Neutral,Neutral
"Mortimer's ""How to read a book"" is a 400 page saga on rules of reading literature, science, maths, history and poetry.",Neutral,Neutral
"I am sure that when it was first published in 1940s, it was the ground breaking first book ever that taught people how to read.",Neutral,Neutral
Its analysis on different levels of reading and types of books must have sounded very revealing to readers.,Neutral,Neutral
"Since you are interested in this book, I would assume that you read a lot of lessons and are mainly looking for something that will increase your speed, this will increase your anxiety.",Neutral,Neutral
The book starts with the Goals of Reading and quickly moves on to different levels of reading,Neutral,Neutral
"In a nutshell all that Mortimer wants to communicate is that there are 2 types of reading, one that you do for entertainment and one for aquiring information or understanding.",Neutral,Neutral
"In both cases, it pays to be an active reader",Neutral,Neutral
"To become an active reader, you have to follow these simple rules",Neutral,Neutral
"Look for the theme, crux of the book",Neutral,Neutral
"Look for outline, structure or organization of the book",Neutral,Neutral
Understand what author is trying to say,Neutral,Neutral
What arguments he gives to support himself,Neutral,Neutral
Arguments against what he wants to disprove,Neutral,Neutral
Terms and language he uses,Neutral,Neutral
This is pretty much the summary of the book.,Neutral,Neutral

If you read this because its Star Wars try to do an experiment or borrow one,Neutral,Neutral
Why did I pick up this book,Neutral,Neutral
because the cover caught my eye and I'm always interested in urban fantasy novels where the main protagonist is male,Neutral,Neutral
So that really peaked my interest.,Neutral,Neutral
I mean you want readers to come back for the rest of the series right,Neutral,Neutral
Santiago of Spain vs.,Neutral,Neutral
Anne of Avonlea It is an odd coincidence that I was three books into the Anne of Avonlea series when I picked up The Alchemist to read.,Neutral,Neutral
I know that they are completely different genres but I couldn't help but compare the two stories,Neutral,Neutral
"There were so many similarities in the characters and message, but the writings were worlds apart",Neutral,Neutral
I know that The Alchemist was not written as a novel and you can't compare the writing styles of the authors,Neutral,Neutral
Santiago and Anne were both educated locally until about the age of 16,Neutral,Neutral
They both love to read and have dreams,Neutral,Neutral
"Santiago wants to travel and see the world, he becomes a shepherd with an inheritance from his father",Neutral,Neutral
Anne wants to further her education and become a teacher and is able to attend Queens Academy with the help of her adopted family,Neutral,Neutral
"While a shepherd, Santiago has a recurring dream about finding a treasure near the Pyramids in Egypt",Neutral,Neutral
As a student Anne dreams of going to Redmond College,Neutral,Neutral
With the help of good omens both are allowed to follow their dreams,Neutral,Neutral
Santiago's good omens appear in the form of a gypsy and a king who help him interpret his dream and encourage him to follow it to Egypt,Neutral,Neutral
He makes it to Tangiers where he is robbed of his money and is forced to find employment with a crystal merchant,Neutral,Neutral
Hence he is delayed a year in continuing his Personal Legend,Neutral,Neutral
Anne is blessed by fate,Neutral,Neutral
"Anne on the other hand, feels sorrow over the lost opportunity",Neutral,Neutral
"After saving up enough money to return to Spain, Santiago finds the desire to again follow his dream and joins a caravan going to Egypt",Neutral,Neutral
"While traveling to Egypt by caravan, Santiago befriends an Englishman who teaches him about alchemy",Neutral,Neutral
Santiago also learns much about listening to his heart and leaning the universal language of all things.,Neutral,Neutral
"She makes friends, and is in tune with her own inner self and with nature around her",Neutral,Neutral
 While at college Anne makes the most of the opportunites available there,Neutral,Neutral
Good things seem to happen to both characters,Neutral,Neutral
This is the universe conspiring to help them fulfill their Personal Legend,Neutral,Neutral
Santiago finds love when he meets Fatima at the oasis where he is delayed in his journey,Neutral,Neutral
He also meets the alchemist who teaches him about the ways of the world and leads him to the Pyramids where he ultimately finds where his treasure really is,Neutral,Neutral
Anne also finds the love of her life also not where she was expecting it,Neutral,Neutral
They both find that their treasure was much closer to home than either of them ever,Neutral,Neutral
Now for the differences,Neutral,Neutral
"In Anne's story, the beauty was in the journey",Neutral,Neutral
"She found so much to be grateful for every day, in every little thing",Neutral,Neutral
The writing of LM Montgomery was exceptional,Neutral,Neutral
While reading these three books,Neutral,Neutral
I didn't get the sense that Anne was teaching me about pursuing my own dreams,Neutral,Neutral
About once every four pages,Neutral,Neutral
But personally I much prefer the writing of LM Montgomery over Paulo Coelho,Neutral,Neutral
"Hmmm. Warning, this book is violent",Neutral,Neutral
Blood spurting,Neutral,Neutral
I don't think this is going in the school library,Neutral,Neutral
I wish Paolini spent more time on developing his characters as he did with the endless battle scenes,Neutral,Neutral
This book was different,Neutral,Neutral
"For instance, in the last CD he spends a significant amount of time talking about why only one parent should work because it's better on the kids",Neutral,Neutral
He also goes on and on about how to be an asset to your company so you will get raises and not get laid off,Neutral,Neutral
This is the type of CD that you will only listen to once so I highly recommend checking it out at your local library and saving the cash,Neutral,Neutral
"After all, you do want to cut down on debt",Neutral,Neutral

"When Fifteen-year-old Christopher John Francis Boone finds a murdered dog in his neighbors's frontyard, he picks him up instinctively",Neutral,Neutral

"However, in doing so, Christopher finds more than he had bargained for",Neutral,Neutral
His simple autistic mind cannot comprehend why anybody would kill a dog,Neutral,Neutral
Does he make it,Neutral,Neutral
What happens to the killer of the dog,Neutral,Neutral
What was the secret about his mother,Neutral,Neutral
Read a few pages before you buy it,Neutral,Neutral
The reason why this book can't be rated a 5 star is because people expect a little more from an author of Time to Kill,Neutral,Neutral
Conclusion Readable if you have nothing else to read ,Neutral,Neutral
When narrator sees an advertisement in a newspaper that claims that a master is seeking students who would like to save the world,Neutral,Neutral

It only takes a minute to do this,Neutral,Neutral
